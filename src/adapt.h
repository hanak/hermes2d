/** \defgroup g_adapt Adaptivity
 *  \brief Adaptivity provides framework for modyfying elements in order to decrease errors of the solution.
 *
 *  Adaptivity classes calculates error of every element.
 *  An error of an element is calculated by comparing an
 *  coarse solution with a reference solution. Errors of
 *  elements defines an order in which elements are examined.
 *  During examining an element, a refinement is proposed
 *  and the element is refined if applicable. The refinement
 *  is proposed through refinement selectors, see \ref g_selectors.
 *
 *  All adaptivity classes have to be derived from the class Adapt.
 *  Curently available classes are:
 *  - H1Adapt
 *  - L2Adapt
 *    \if H2D_COMPLEX # -HcurlAdapt \endif
